<h3>Student Progression Outcomes Calculator</h3>

<p>This repository contains Python scripts designed to calculate the progression outcomes of students in a university based on their credit scores. The scripts offer both student and staff versions, allowing for efficient data entry and outcome analysis.</p><br>


<h3>Files:</h3>

<h5>1). Grade Evaluation System - Method 1</h5>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> This script calculates student progression outcomes using basic Python logic and control flow. It categorizes students into "Progress," "Module Trailer," "Module Retriever," and "Exclude" based on predefined criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Features:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Student and staff versions available.</li>
        <li>Input validation for correct credit score ranges.</li>
        <li>Histogram display of outcome distribution.</li>
        <li>Detailed outcome printing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Run the script and follow the prompts to enter student data. Choose the student or staff version as required.</li>
  </ul>

<h5>2). Garde Evaluation System - Method 2</h5>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Description:</strong> This updated version of the script incorporates improvements such as storing outcomes in separate lists, modularizing functions, and saving outcomes to a text file named "COURSE.txt" for data persistence.</li>
 <li><strong>Features:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li>Enhanced code structure for better readability and maintainability.</li>
   <li>Data persistence through text file storage.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Run the script and follow the prompts to enter student data. Choose the student or staff version as required. View outcomes in the text file generated.</li>
</ul>



<h5>3). Grade Evaluation System - Method 3</h5>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Description:</strong> This version further refines the script by utilizing a dictionary to store progression outcomes with student IDs as keys. It provides a more efficient way to associate outcomes with specific students.</li>
 <li><strong>Features:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li>Outcome storage in a dictionary for easy data retrieval.</li>
   <li>Improved data organization and management.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Run the script and follow the prompts to enter student data. Choose the student or staff version as required. View outcomes printed alongside student IDs.</li>
</ul>


<h5>4). Grade Evaluation System -  Method 4</h5>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Description:</strong> This final version of the script builds upon the previous versions by incorporating error handling for invalid student IDs and refining the output formatting.</li>
 <li><strong>Features:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li>Error handling for incorrect student IDs.</li>
   <li>Improved output formatting for better readability.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Run the script and follow the prompts to enter student data. Choose the student or staff version as required. View outcomes printed alongside student IDs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
